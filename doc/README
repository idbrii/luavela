dlmalloc-2.8.4
    This is the prototype implementation of lj_alloc memory allocator. It was 'heavily customized', resulting in loss of cross-platform support and all valuable comments.
    In this case, the comments are actually valuable, since allocator implementation is twisted and utilizes some complicated (yet efficient) algorithms and data structures.
    Reference implementation is much easier to understand and easy to apply, since majority of names were unchanged.
