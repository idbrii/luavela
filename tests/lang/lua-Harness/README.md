# lua-Harness test suite

This is a modified lua-Harness test suite from
https://framagit.org/fperrad/lua-Harness. (Cloned from
[119ee537](https://framagit.org/fperrad/lua-Harness/commit/119ee5376906813038f0f59c32bd806dceb26270))

For lua-Harness license infomation see suite/COPYRIGHT.

Currently we run with LuaJIT 2.0 (Lua 5.2 compat) profile with some tests
modified to expect some functions to behave like Lua 5.1 does. For
modifications, search for "UJIT:" comments.
